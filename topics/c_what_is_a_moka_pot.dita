        <p>The moka pot is a stovetop coffee maker for brewing coffee by passing boiling water
            pressurised by steam through ground coffee. Italian engineer Alfonso Bialetti invented
            the moka pot in 1933, and Bialetti Industries up to the present continues to produce the
            same model under the trade name "Moka Express".</p>

            <p>Moka pot coffee is not espresso!</p>
            <p>Espresso is a method of brewing, and it requires ~9 bars of pressure to process. On
                the other hand, moka pots use 1â€“1.5 bars of pressure. This means the coffee brewed
                using moka pot is robust and extremely strong, but it is not espresso.</p>
